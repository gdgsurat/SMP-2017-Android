1.  stdint.h is a header file that specifies exact width integer types.

2.  These specify how we want to use data
    uint8_t - 8 bit unsigned int value
    uint32_t- 32 bit unsigned int value
    int32_t - 32 bit signed int value
    uint16_t- 16 bit unsigned int value

3.  BYTE -  1 byte
    DWORD - 4 byte
    LONG -  4 byte
    WORD -  2 byte

4.  ASCII - "BM"
    Hex   -  0x42 0x4D

5.  bfSize - it is the size of whole file which include all the header files
    biSize - it is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER header file which is constant i.e 40.

6. biHeight - Specifies the height of the bitmap, in pixels. For uncompressed RGB bitmaps, if biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB with the origin at the lower left corner. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

7.  biBitCount

8.  if the file does not exist 
   or it is protected with some permissions like read only , or write protected
    in these cases it might return NULL.
    
9.  it is the quantity that we require there,
    so we need only need to read one struct at a time.
    
10.padding will be assigned a value of 3.

11. it moves to the specific location in file.

12. Specifies that offset is a count of characters from the current file position. This count may be positive or negative.
